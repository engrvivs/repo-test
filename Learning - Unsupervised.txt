Unlabelled Training Data
[Training Data - Unlabelled.png]
	- no separate colors for different dots

	No labels are given to the learning algorithm, 
		leaving it on its own to find structure in its input
	discovering hidden patterns in data
	feature learning

	K-means
	Apriori
	Hierarchical

	segment customers by behavioral characteristics
	categorize MRI data by normal or abnormal 
	recommend products to customers based on past purchases
		colaborative filtering model based on past purchases

Clustering: 
	[Task 1] find groups of coherent or cohesive data points in the input space
		based on some form of assumed bias
			like, ellipsoid cluster groups [Possible Clusters.png]
	a set of inputs is to be divided into cohesive groups
		categories of customers coming to a shop - college students, young IT professionals, etc.
	Unlike in classification: 
		groups are not known beforehand
		-> typically an unsupervised task
	//
	[Task 2] Not all data points need to fall into clusters
		known as outliers
			do not conform to the patterns of the input
		an artifact of the assumed bias (ellipsoids)
	//
	Discover:
		classes of customers from their data
			for tageted promotions
		different regions among image pixels
			for segmentation to make more sense out of the image
			finding clouds, sand, sea, trea from a beach scene picture
			[Image Segmentation.png]
		synonyms from words usages
		different topics in documents


Association rule (Frequent pattern) mining:
	[Stage 1] find ALL frequent co-occurrence (patterns) of items in the given data
		whenever A comes to shop, B also comes to the shop
	[Stage 2] derive conditional dependencies (associations) from these frequent patterns
	//
	Find patterns in (data):
		sequences
			time-series
				look at triggers for certain events
			fault analysis
				by looking at the sequence of events that happened
				which event occurs more often with the fault - cause(s) of faults
		graphs
			social network analysis
				which kind of interactions, among entities, happen often
		transactions mining 
			transaction - a collection of items, bought together
			itemset: a (sub)set of items
			1. find frequent itemsets
			2. Itemset A => (implies) Itemset B, if both A and (A U B) are frequent itemsets
			//
			predicting co-occurrence of events
			market basket analysis
			time-series analysis to recognize triggerring events
