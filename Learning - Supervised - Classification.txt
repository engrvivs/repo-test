Experience or Training (Labeled) Data Set Input [[Training Data - Labelled.png]]
	some description of data as attributes is available
		e.g., customer's age and income (both are attributes)
		to build a classifier
	normalize data (encode)

Goal: To predict
	e.g., if the customer will buy a particular product or not
	Output is discrete value - classification into Labels
		e.g., yes or no


Methodology of Training Algo:
	Come up with a mapping classifier function
		to map input to output

Many different ways of coming up with this mapping function (classifiers):
	If data is viewed geometrically, like, points in space,
		then function can be defined through lines or curves on the input space

Trade-off between Classifier's complexity and accuracy (Performance)
	is complexity worth vs time and money and resources


Inductive Bias:
	assumption about the input data's distribution
		lines, curves can segregate data into different categories (classes)
	Language Bias
		straight / slanted lines, curves and their orders
	Search Bias
		in what order, will lines be examined
	helps to generalize from few training points to the entire space

Curves/Lines implemented through different structures

Different kinds of learning mechanisms:
	ANN
	SVM
	Decision Trees
	Nearest Neighbours
	Bayesian Networks


Validation through Test set
	we know what the labels are
	not earlier shown to the Training Algo
	gives feedback to the Training Algo to change parameters for estimation

Training Algo - for classification and regression
	Learning Algo - feedback system

Supervised learning: 
	The computer is presented with "example" inputs and their desired outputs, 
		given by a "teacher", 
	goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs
		input: 
			patient, who comes to clinic
			certain equation
			question description
		output: 
			whether he has a specific disease or not
			equation's output
			true or false
	As special cases, the input signal can be: 
		only partially available, or 
		restricted to special feedback
		
	Linear Regression
	Random Forest
	Support Vector Machines

	Cortana, Siri or any speech-recognition system
	Weather app
		sunny - temp. high
		cloudy - high humidity
	Identification through biometrics
	Credit worthiness of credit card holder
	Credit card fraud detection - valid transaction or not
	patient readmission rate
	products, customers buy together
	Sentiment analysis
		opinion mining
		buzz analysis
		based on review, check whether it is +ve or -ve and what are the specific points
	Potential Churner's prediction	
		will customer leave your service or continue using your product
	Medical diagnosis
		risk analysis

based on desired outputs:
	classification: 
		categorical output
			whether a patient has a disease or not
			answer is true or false
		inputs are divided into two or more classes, and 
		the learner must produce a model 
			that assigns unseen inputs to 
				one or more (multi-label classification) of these classes
		-> typically, tackled in a supervised way
		e.g., Spam filtering:
			inputs - email (or other) messages 
			classes - "spam" and "not spam"
	
	regression
		outputs are continuous 
			rather than discrete
				how long will this product last, before it fails?
				what is the expected rainfall, tomorrow?
		-> a supervised problem, the .
