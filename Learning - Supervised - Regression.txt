Regression or Prediction

Predicted outputs are continuous real value
	rather than discrete

Input
	Temp. vs Time of Day
		how long will this product last, before it fails?
		
-> a supervised problem, the .


Overfitting
	trying to fit the noise in data
	avoided through regularization(?)

Linear Regression
	minimize sum of squared (prediction) errors

Basis transformation to Higher Dimensions
	(x1, x2) -> (x1^2, x2^2, x1*x2, x1, x2) 
		in 5 dimension - linear plane
		in 2 dimension - 2nd order polynomial
fitting a (any-order) function that is linear in input variables
	
Time-series prediction
	rainfall in certain area
		what is the expected rainfall, tomorrow?
	spend on voice calls
Classification
Data reduction
	by fitting the curve to numerous data points
		and sharing co-efficients of the line/curve
			sufficient to get sense of data
Trend analysis
	e.g., running time scales linearly or exponentially with input size
	Linear
	Exponential
Risk factor analysis
	factors contributing most to the input


Supervised learning: 
	The computer is presented with "example" inputs and their desired outputs, 
		given by a "teacher", 
	goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs
		input: 
			patient, who comes to clinic
			certain equation
			question description
		output: 
			whether he has a specific disease or not
			equation's output
			true or false
	As special cases, the input signal can be: 
		only partially available, or 
		restricted to special feedback
		
	Linear Regression
	Random Forest
	Support Vector Machines

	Cortana, Siri or any speech-recognition system
	Weather app
		sunny - temp. high
		cloudy - high humidity
	Identification through biometrics
	Credit worthiness of credit card holder
	Credit card fraud detection - valid transaction or not
	patient readmission rate
	products, customers buy together
	Sentiment analysis
		opinion mining
		buzz analysis
		based on review, check whether it is +ve or -ve and what are the specific points
	Potential Churner's prediction	
		will customer leave your service or continue using your product
	Medical diagnosis
		risk analysis
	time spend on voice calls
	Data reduction by sending co-efficient of curves to get the sense of the data trend
